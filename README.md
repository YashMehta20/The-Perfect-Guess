# The-Perfect-Guess
Hello All,
After learning basics and OOP of Python I have created a game called The Perfect Guess. In the game, I have used Random Module/Library of Python and I have asked the user to guess the number between 1 to 100 which the user would have guessed after computer selects one number between 1 to 100 using random function.I have printed the number of guess in new text file if the guesses have broke the previous record.
